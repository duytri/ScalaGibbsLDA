Context-aware recommender systems CARS aiming to further improve recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction by taking context information into account has become the hottest research topic in the field of recommendation Integrating context information into recommendation frameworks is challenging owing to the high dimensionality of context information and the sparsity of the observations which state-of-the-art methods do not handle well We suggest a novel approach for context-aware recommendation based on Item-grain context clustering named IC-CARS which first extracts context clusters for each item based on K-means method then incorporates context clusters into Matrix Factorization model and thus helps to overcome the often encountered problem of data sparsity scalability and prediction quality Experiments on two real-world datasets and the complexity analysis show that IC-CARS is scalable and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for recommending

Mobile phones are becoming an integral part of everyone's life They provide much more functionality besides their basic functions of making calls and sending messages With the advent of mobile operating systems mobile phones are able to install application that perform various tasks ranging from simple multimedia playback to more complex function such as banking text editing and much more With the number of application installed on a mobile phone increases the most used application's shortcuts are placed on the mobiles home screen In this paper we propose a location based context-aware user interface recommendation system that adapts to the application usage preference based on the users current location The recommendation system is implemented using Apriori and FP growth Association Rule mining techniques The efficiency of the system is evaluated by reviewing the user
Context has been recognized as an important factor to consider in personalized Recommender Systems However most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model In this work we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix In the proposed model called Multiverse Recommendation different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations We provide an algorithm to address the N-dimensional factorization and show that the Multiverse Recommendation improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to 30% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error MAE We also compare to two state-of-the-art context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them both in semi-synthetic and real-world data - improvements range from 25% to more than 12% depending on the data Noticeably our approach outperforms other methods by a wider margin whenever more contextual information is available
Context aware recommender systems CARS adapt the recommendations to the specific situation in which the items will be consumed In this paper we present a novel context-aware recommendation algorithm that extends Matrix Factorization We model the interaction of the contextual factors with item ratings introducing additional model parameters The performed experiments show that the proposed solution provides comparable results to the best state of the art and more complex approaches The proposed solution has the advantage of smaller computational cost and provides the possibility to represent at different granularities the interaction between context and items We have exploited the proposed model in two recommendation applications: places of interest and music
The article presents a multidimensional MD approach to recommender systems that can provide recommendations based on additional contextual information besides the typical information on users and items used in most of the current recommender systems This approach supports multiple dimensions profiling information and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made and the tradeoffs between the two are studied Moreover the article introduces a combined rating estimation method which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere Finally the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance
The emergence and penetration of smart mobile devices has given rise to the development of context-aware systems that utilize sensors to collect available data about users in order to improve various user services Recently the use of context-aware recommender systems CARS aimed at recommending items to users has expanded particularly those that consider user context Adding context to recommendation systems is challenging because the addition of various environmental contexts to the recommendation process results in the expansion of its dimensionality and thus increases sparsity Therefore existing CARS tend to incorporate a small set of pre-defined explicit contexts which do not necessary represent user context or reflect the optimal set of features for the recommendation process We suggest a novel approach centered on representing environmental features as low dimensional unsupervised latent contexts We extract data from a rich set of mobile sensors in order to infer unexplored user contexts in an unsupervised manner The latent contexts are hidden context patterns modeled as numeric vectors which are efficiently extracted from raw sensor data The latent contexts are automatically learned for each user utilizing unsupervised deep learning techniques and PCA on the data collected from the user's mobile phone Integrating the data extracted from high dimensional sensors into a new latent context-aware recommendation algorithm results in up to a 20% increase in recommendation accuracy
Decisions are taken by humans very often during professional as well as leisure activities It is particularly evident during surfing the Internet: selecting web sites to explore choosing needed information in search engine results or deciding which product to buy in an on-line store Recommender systems are electronic applications the aim of which is to support humans in this decision making process They are widely used in many applications: adaptive WWW servers e-learning music and video preferences internet stores etc In on-line solutions such as e-shops or libraries the aim of recommendations is to show customers the products which they are probably interested in As input data the following are taken: shopping basket archives ratings of the products or servers log files The article presents a solution of recommender system which helps users to select an interesting product The system analyses data from other customers' ratings of the products It uses clustering methods to find similarities among the users and proposed techniques to identify users' profiles The system was implemented in Apache Mahout environment and tested on a movie database Selected similarity measures are based on: Euclidean distance cosine as well as correlation coefficient and loglikehood function
In this paper we present a context-aware collaborative filtering system that predicts a user’s preference in different context situations based on past experiences We extend collaborative filtering techniques so that what other like-minded users have done in similar context can be used to predict a user’s preference towards an activity in the current context Such a system can help predict the user’s behavior in different situations without the user actively defining it For example it could recommend activities customized for Bob for the given weather location and traveling companions based on what other people like Bob have done in similar context
Recently mood has proved to be an important contextual feature in context-aware recommender systems CARS by some studies In this paper we propose two new approaches to mood-based hybrid collaborative filtering CF in order to further improve the performance accuracy and user satisfaction by utilizing emotional context in CARS We first describe the traditional user-based CF as the baseline approach and then propose a new mood-based user-based CF which detects user preferences to each emotion On this basis we propose two hybrid CF approaches using multiple-step nearest neighbors search and predicted ratings fusion strategies respectively We perform experimental comparisons of the above approaches on the Moviepilot dataset released for the Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation CAMRa2010 The results suggest that both hybrid approaches provide improvements in performance
Traditional recommendation approaches do not consider the changes of user preferences according to context As a result these approaches consider the user’s overall preferences although the user preferences on items varies according to his/her context However in our context-aware approach we take into account not only user preferences but also context information Our approach can be easily adopted for content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendations To exploit raw context information in recommendation we abstract the raw context information to a concept level Moreover by aggregating the context information we can improve the quality of recommendation The results of several experiments show that our method is more precise than the traditional recommendation approaches
Context-aware recommendation seeks to improve recommendation performance by exploiting various information sources in addition to the conventional user-item matrix used by recommender systems Recommendations should also usually strive to satisfy a specific purpose Within the Moviepilot mood track of the context-aware movie recommendation challenge we propose a novel movie similarity measure that is specific to the movie property demanded by the challenge ie movie mood Our measure is further exploited by a joint matrix factorization model for recommendation We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in exploiting mood-specific movie similarity for the recommendation with respect to several evaluation metrics demonstrating that it could outperform several state-of-the-art approaches In particular mood-specific movie similarity is demonstrated to be more beneficial than general mood-based movie similarity for the purpose of mood-specific recommendation
