Context-aware recommender systems CARS aiming to further improve recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction by taking context information into account has become the hottest research topic in the field of recommendation Integrating context information into recommendation frameworks is challenging owing to the high dimensionality of context information and the sparsity of the observations which state-of-the-art methods do not handle well We suggest a novel approach for context-aware recommendation based on Item-grain context clustering named IC-CARS which first extracts context clusters for each item based on K-means method then incorporates context clusters into Matrix Factorization model and thus helps to overcome the often encountered problem of data sparsity scalability and prediction quality Experiments on two real-world datasets and the complexity analysis show that IC-CARS is scalable and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for recommending

Mobile phones are becoming an integral part of everyone's life They provide much more functionality besides their basic functions of making calls and sending messages With the advent of mobile operating systems mobile phones are able to install application that perform various tasks ranging from simple multimedia playback to more complex function such as banking text editing and much more With the number of application installed on a mobile phone increases the most used application's shortcuts are placed on the mobiles home screen In this paper we propose a location based context-aware user interface recommendation system that adapts to the application usage preference based on the users current location The recommendation system is implemented using Apriori and FP growth Association Rule mining techniques The efficiency of the system is evaluated by reviewing the user
Context has been recognized as an important factor to consider in personalized Recommender Systems However most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model In this work we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix In the proposed model called Multiverse Recommendation different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations We provide an algorithm to address the N-dimensional factorization and show that the Multiverse Recommendation improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to 30% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error MAE We also compare to two state-of-the-art context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them both in semi-synthetic and real-world data - improvements range from 25% to more than 12% depending on the data Noticeably our approach outperforms other methods by a wider margin whenever more contextual information is available
Context aware recommender systems CARS adapt the recommendations to the specific situation in which the items will be consumed In this paper we present a novel context-aware recommendation algorithm that extends Matrix Factorization We model the interaction of the contextual factors with item ratings introducing additional model parameters The performed experiments show that the proposed solution provides comparable results to the best state of the art and more complex approaches The proposed solution has the advantage of smaller computational cost and provides the possibility to represent at different granularities the interaction between context and items We have exploited the proposed model in two recommendation applications: places of interest and music
The article presents a multidimensional MD approach to recommender systems that can provide recommendations based on additional contextual information besides the typical information on users and items used in most of the current recommender systems This approach supports multiple dimensions profiling information and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made and the tradeoffs between the two are studied Moreover the article introduces a combined rating estimation method which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere Finally the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance
The emergence and penetration of smart mobile devices has given rise to the development of context-aware systems that utilize sensors to collect available data about users in order to improve various user services Recently the use of context-aware recommender systems CARS aimed at recommending items to users has expanded particularly those that consider user context Adding context to recommendation systems is challenging because the addition of various environmental contexts to the recommendation process results in the expansion of its dimensionality and thus increases sparsity Therefore existing CARS tend to incorporate a small set of pre-defined explicit contexts which do not necessary represent user context or reflect the optimal set of features for the recommendation process We suggest a novel approach centered on representing environmental features as low dimensional unsupervised latent contexts We extract data from a rich set of mobile sensors in order to infer unexplored user contexts in an unsupervised manner The latent contexts are hidden context patterns modeled as numeric vectors which are efficiently extracted from raw sensor data The latent contexts are automatically learned for each user utilizing unsupervised deep learning techniques and PCA on the data collected from the user's mobile phone Integrating the data extracted from high dimensional sensors into a new latent context-aware recommendation algorithm results in up to a 20% increase in recommendation accuracy
Decisions are taken by humans very often during professional as well as leisure activities It is particularly evident during surfing the Internet: selecting web sites to explore choosing needed information in search engine results or deciding which product to buy in an on-line store Recommender systems are electronic applications the aim of which is to support humans in this decision making process They are widely used in many applications: adaptive WWW servers e-learning music and video preferences internet stores etc In on-line solutions such as e-shops or libraries the aim of recommendations is to show customers the products which they are probably interested in As input data the following are taken: shopping basket archives ratings of the products or servers log files The article presents a solution of recommender system which helps users to select an interesting product The system analyses data from other customers' ratings of the products It uses clustering methods to find similarities among the users and proposed techniques to identify users' profiles The system was implemented in Apache Mahout environment and tested on a movie database Selected similarity measures are based on: Euclidean distance cosine as well as correlation coefficient and loglikehood function
In this paper we present a context-aware collaborative filtering system that predicts a user’s preference in different context situations based on past experiences We extend collaborative filtering techniques so that what other like-minded users have done in similar context can be used to predict a user’s preference towards an activity in the current context Such a system can help predict the user’s behavior in different situations without the user actively defining it For example it could recommend activities customized for Bob for the given weather location and traveling companions based on what other people like Bob have done in similar context
Recently mood has proved to be an important contextual feature in context-aware recommender systems CARS by some studies In this paper we propose two new approaches to mood-based hybrid collaborative filtering CF in order to further improve the performance accuracy and user satisfaction by utilizing emotional context in CARS We first describe the traditional user-based CF as the baseline approach and then propose a new mood-based user-based CF which detects user preferences to each emotion On this basis we propose two hybrid CF approaches using multiple-step nearest neighbors search and predicted ratings fusion strategies respectively We perform experimental comparisons of the above approaches on the Moviepilot dataset released for the Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation CAMRa2010 The results suggest that both hybrid approaches provide improvements in performance
Traditional recommendation approaches do not consider the changes of user preferences according to context As a result these approaches consider the user’s overall preferences although the user preferences on items varies according to his/her context However in our context-aware approach we take into account not only user preferences but also context information Our approach can be easily adopted for content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendations To exploit raw context information in recommendation we abstract the raw context information to a concept level Moreover by aggregating the context information we can improve the quality of recommendation The results of several experiments show that our method is more precise than the traditional recommendation approaches
Context-aware recommendation seeks to improve recommendation performance by exploiting various information sources in addition to the conventional user-item matrix used by recommender systems Recommendations should also usually strive to satisfy a specific purpose Within the Moviepilot mood track of the context-aware movie recommendation challenge we propose a novel movie similarity measure that is specific to the movie property demanded by the challenge ie movie mood Our measure is further exploited by a joint matrix factorization model for recommendation We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in exploiting mood-specific movie similarity for the recommendation with respect to several evaluation metrics demonstrating that it could outperform several state-of-the-art approaches In particular mood-specific movie similarity is demonstrated to be more beneficial than general mood-based movie similarity for the purpose of mood-specific recommendation
Collaborative Filtering CF recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings This has been validated extensively but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions such as the time or the goal of the item consumption This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting In this approach the ratings of certain items are split according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings
Collaborative Filtering CF computes recommendations by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items CF assumes that the users' recorded ratings can help in predicting their future ratings This has been validated extensively but in some domains the user's ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions such as the time or the goal of the item consumption This type of contextual information is not exploited by standard CF models This paper introduces and analyzes a novel technique for context-aware CF called Item Splitting In this approach items experienced in two alternative contextual conditions are split into two items This means that the ratings of a split item eg a place to visit are assigned split to two new fictitious items representing for instance the place in summer and the same place in winter This split is performed only if there is statistical evidence that under these two contextual conditions the items ratings are different; for instance a place may be rated higher in summer than in winter These two new fictitious items are then used together with the unaffected items in the rating prediction algorithm When the system must predict the rating for that split item in a particular contextual condition eg in summer it will consider the new fictitious item representing the original one in that particular contextual condition and will predict its rating We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms We show that Item Splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the method used to determine which items to split We also show that the benefit of the method is determined by the relevance of the contextual factors that are used to split
Many factors that influence users’ decision making processes in Recommender Systems RSs have been investigated by a relatively vast research of empirical and theoretical nature mostly in the field of e-commerce In this paper we discuss some aspects of the user experience with RSs that may affect the decision making process and outcome and have been marginally addressed by prior research These include the nature of users’ goals and the dynamic characteristics of the resources space eg availability during the search process We argue that these subjective and objective factors of the user experience with a RS call for a rethinking of the decision making process as it is normally assumed in traditional RSs and raise a number or research challenges These concepts are exemplified in the application domain of on-line services specifically hotel booking- a field where we are carrying on a number of activities in cooperation with a large stakeholder Venerecom – a company of Expedia Inc Still most of the arguments discussed in the paper can be extended to other domains and have general implications for RS design and evaluation

Here we propose an OWL encoded context ontology CONON for modeling context in pervasive computing environments and for supporting logic-based context reasoning CONON provides an upper context ontology that captures general concepts about basic context and also provides extensibility for adding domain-specific ontology in a hierarchical manner Based on this context ontology we have studied the use of logic reasoning to check the consistency of context information and to reason over low-level explicit context to derive high-level implicit context By giving a performance study for our prototype we quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of logic based context reasoning for nontime-critical applications in pervasive computing environments where we always have to deal carefully with the limitation of computational resources

Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation including content-based collaborative knowledge-based and other techniques To improve performance these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders and introduces a novel hybrid EntreeC a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants Further we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering
Recommender systems are efficient tools that overcome the information overload problem by providing users with the most relevant contents This is generally done through user’s preferences/ratings acquired from log files of his former ses-sions Besides these preferences taking into account the interaction context of the user will improve the relevancy of recommendation process In this paper we propose a context-aware recommender system based on both user pro-file and context The approach we present is based on a previous work on data personalization which leads to the definition of a Personalized Access Model that provides a set of personalization services We show how these services can be deployed in order to provide advanced context-aware recommender systems
Future computing environments will free the user from the constraints of the desktop Applications for a mobile environment should take advantage of contextual information such as position to offer greater services to the user In this paper we present the Cyberguide project in which we are building prototypes of a mobile context-aware tour guide Knowledge of the user's current location as well as a history of past locations are used to provide more of the kind of services that we come to expect from a real tour guide We describe the architecture and features of a variety of Cyberguide prototypes developed for indoor and outdoor use on a number of different hand-held platforms We also discuss the general research issues that have emerged in our context-aware applications development in a mobile environment
As wireless communication advances research on location-based services using mobile devices has attracted interest which provides information and services related to user's physical location As increasing information and services it becomes difficult to find a proper service that reflects the individual preference at proper time Due to the small screen of mobile devices and insufficiency of resources personalized services and convenient user interface might be useful In this paper we propose a map-based personalized recommendation system which reflects user's preference modeled by Bayesian Networks BN The structure of BN is built by an expert while the parameter is learned from the dataset The proposed system collects context information location time weather and user request from the mobile device and infers the most preferred item to provide an appropriate service by displaying onto the mini map

Collaborative and content-based filtering are two paradigms that have been applied in the context of recommender systems and user preference prediction This paper proposes a novel unified approach that systematically integrates all available training information such as past user-item ratings as well as attributes of items or users to learn a prediction function The key ingredient of our method is the design of a suitable kernel or similarity function between user-item pairs that allows simultaneous generalization across the user and item dimensions We propose an on-line algorithm JRank that generalizes perceptron learning Experimental results on the EachMovie data set show significant improvements over standard approaches
A finite concave minimization algorithm is proposed for constructing kernel classifiers that use a minimal number of data points both in generating and characterizing a classifier The algorithm is theoretically justified on the basis of linear programming perturbation theory and a leave-one-out error bound as well as effective computational results on seven real world datasets A nonlinear rectangular kernel is generated by systematically utilizing as few of the data as possible both in training and in characterizing a nonlinear separating surface This can result in substantial reduction in kernel data-dependence over 94% in six of the seven public datasets tested on and with test set correctness equal to that obtained by using a conventional support vector machine classifier that depends on many more data points This reduction in data dependence results in a much faster classifier that requires less storage To eliminate data points the proposed approach makes use of a novel loss function the pound function ·# which is a linear combination of the 1-norm and the step function that measures both the magnitude and the presence of any error
In order to generate relevant recommendations a context-aware recommender system CARS not only makes use of user preferences but also exploits information about the specific contextual situation in which the recommended item will be consumed For instance when recommending a holiday destination a CARS could take into account whether the trip will happen in summer or winter It is unclear however which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships In this paper we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings To this end we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor eg season influences the rating given a certain contextual condition eg season is summer Based on the analyses of these data we built a context-aware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important In a subsequent user evaluation this system was preferred to a similar variant that did not exploit contextual information

Recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products services and information items to potential consumers Collaborative filtering the most successful recommendation approach makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests In this article we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach two variations of the user-based approach and an item-based approach Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision recall the F-measure and the rank score We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach that is incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may dilute the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance
We describe an efficient framework for Web personalizationbased on sequential and non-sequential pattern discov-eryfrom usage data Our experimental results performedon real usage data indicate that more restrictive patternssuch as contiguous sequential patterns eg frequent navigationalpaths are more suitable for predictive tasks suchas Web prefetching which involve predicting which item isaccessed next by a user while less constrained patternssuch as frequent itemsets or general sequential patterns aremore effective alternatives in the context of Web personalizationand recommender systems
